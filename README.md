# roll20_britannia

## Project Notes
- The python script image_manip.py was used to change all of the UO tiles from displaying the art rotated 45 degrees for the UO isometric to a vertical in order to support roll20.
- To recreate - save all landtile files from [UOFiddler](http://uofiddler.polserver.com/) to the `tileset` folder and create a subfolder of `tileset` named `processed`
